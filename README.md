Briefing:

Hi, we’re designing PetTracker, a pet health tracker application, that will help pet owners with sick pets. It’s main functionalities are sending reminders to administer medication, logging symptoms, and managing your pet’s medical records.

The purpose of this trial is to test our paper prototype interface and as such we will be taking notes of your trial so we can make our interface more user-friendly in the future.

This study is for a course we’re taking in Human-Computer Interaction with Professor David Sprague in the College of Computer of Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and should you choose you may stop the trial at any time. Do we have your consent to run this study?

Great. We will be giving you 3 different tasks and your job is to use the paper prototype interface to complete these tasks.The three tasks we will be asking you to complete are: entering a sample symptom for tracking, checking off a reminder telling you to give your pet medicine, and exporting your pets medical history to give to a vet.

Please do not be afraid to tell us if something is unclear or you don’t know how to do something. If you are struggling, do not worry; we are testing the interface, not you. Let us know what find confusing or your general thought process and we will help you accordingly.

We will start the study with a few questions. After, you will be given a task to read and perform. Each test will start from the main app screen and once you complete a task you will be returned to the main screen for the next task. Any questions before we begin?

Tasks:

1.Enter a symptom for tracking
2.Check off a reminder telling you to give your pet medicine
3.Exporting your pets medical history to give to a vet.
